# Named_Entity_Recognition-NER-and-Feature_Engineering
 This repository implements machine learning models to predict article engagement. It includes Logistic Regression for classification and Random Forest Regression for predicting numerical engagement scores, using features like sentiment, entity counts, and title length. The Random Forest model outperforms Logistic Regression in predictive accuracy.
### Key Features:
Logistic Regression: Used for classifying articles based on engagement (popularity).
Random Forest Regression: Used to predict the numerical engagement score of articles.

### Performance Metrics:
Accuracy: Measures the proportion of correctly predicted classes.
F1 Score: Balances precision and recall, useful for imbalanced classification problems.
Classification Report: Provides a detailed breakdown of precision, recall, and F1 score for each class.

### Results:
The Random Forest model outperforms Logistic Regression in predictive accuracy, demonstrating its ability to capture non-linear relationships between the features.
